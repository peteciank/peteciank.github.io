## Bio

I currently work on building, understanding, and integrating machine learning/artificial intelligent systems with the Agile Project and Product Management in software development.

I'm currently creating solutions using Machine Learning Models and Large Language Models to forecast effort, describe business requirements and create MVPs in just couple of days. 

I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning, intelligent agents, and how this will impact health, education, economy and more. 

I completed my MBA oriented in Artificial Intelligence work in Educational opportunities for people without higher education to get their first job. 

My MBA was awarded by Hult International Business School.
